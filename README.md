# Student-Feedback-Analyzer
Student Feedback Analyzer is a Python-based desktop application which is developed with a motive to change the existing feedback system used in colleges that uses multiple options in the form of radio button in a form to find out the feedback of the student on a particular subject or a faculty. The application uses textblob to find the polarity of a feedback given by the subject and stores it in a database. Later the Administrator can find out the feedback score of each faculty and / or subject using the admin module.
